        In this part, I adapted the following SuperCollider code to JavaScript
        and the WebAudio API:

      <p>This is the Audio Signal flow graph for the cricket sound.</p>
      <p>
        The first thing I did was create a white noise buffer and a
        corresponding GainNode. To implement the "bursts" of sound he talks
        about in the textbook, I knew I would need some kind of LFO acting on
        the noise's gain to create a rhythmic pulse. After some testing, I
        decided on a triangle waveform for the LFO - it sounded the best.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, I just had bursts of white noise. Per the high-level
        description I was referencing, I created a lowpass filter (with a
        relatively high frequency - 2000) to take the "edge" off of the pulse.
        Then I fed the output of that filter through a bunch of
        differently-tuned bandpass filters. Each bandpass filter had a different
        GainNode associated with it. Lastly, I connected all the bandpass
        outputs to a highpass filter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hardest part of this assignment was tuning the parameters of the
        filters. All of the bandpass filters have the same Q-value (they were
        initialized in a loop). The Q value is very high because when I set it
        that high the higher frequencies jumped out of the noise, which it
        sounded most cricket-like.
